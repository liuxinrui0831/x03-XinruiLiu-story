dangerous monster living in the forest called Anjanath. His father was
killed by the Anjanath, so he decided to kill this monster to revenge
for his father, as well as to prove that he was a great hunter.

He spent years tracking the beast, eventually finding it's dwelling under
a cave in Antarctica. The monster was a massive 500 pound 8 legged 10 headed
dragon. It breathed fire and shot bullets out of it's eyes. The beast was
so massive that it took up Gordon's dining and event center
