Once upon a time, there was hunter living in a forest. There was a very
dangerous monster living in the forest called Anjanath. His father was
killed by the Anjanath, so he decided to kill this monster to revenge
for his father, as well as to prove that he was a great hunter.

He spent years tracking the beast, eventually finding it's dwelling under
a cave in Antarctica. The monster was a massive 500 pound 8 legged 10 headed
dragon. It breathed fire and shot bullets out of it's eyes. The beast was
so massive that it took up Gordon's dining and event center

The hunter was so terrified by the beasts size, that he ran away to the 
neighboring iceberg. After calming himself down, the hunter decided to make
a strategic plan to lure the beat out of the cave and into the water where
its fire wouldn't work.

From Hunter's Handbook, the hunter knowed that that monster liked honey.
He then took honey out of his bag and pour it onto ground. Aftering setting trap,
he hided in a bush nearby and readied his weapon-- a magical shotgun.

He killed the beast in one shot. He brought the spoils of the war back to his village
where he was greatly celebrated. The town threw a feast and he was showered with riches.
He had an exausting adventure and was ready to go to sleep. He blew out the candle
and went straight to bed.

However, the hunter didn't know that he was cursed. In this world, every hunter who
killed Anjanath would be the next Anjanath. When he woke up, he found that he became
a massive 500 pound 8 leggged 10 headed dragon, but he didn't realize that he 
actually breathe fire. Shhhhhh. Huuuuuu. He took a deep breath to relax and calm down.
And then, he killed an innocent hunter with the fire coming out of his nose....
